# Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely utilized in machine learning (ML) models with the ability to extract features from massive quantities of data in a hierarchical way via several transformation layers \cite{yang2019time}. Therefore, our goal was to develop a faster and more efficient transformational layer namely quantum convolutional or quanvolutional layer for an image processing task.  The transformed data from the quantum circuit  used for generating meaningful features for the image classification. Thus, this work focused on utilizing CNNs and quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) on the MNIST image dataset to assess the potential impact of the quantum transformations for image classification.
